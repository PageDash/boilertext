# BoilerText

BoilerText is a Go implementation of the algorithm to remove boilerplate text from HTML files as described by http://www.l3s.de/~kohlschuetter/boilerplate. The paper is found [here](http://www.l3s.de/~kohlschuetter/publications/wsdm187-kohlschuetter.pdf) (PDF).

The reference implementation is found in https://github.com/PageDash/boilerpipe (forked from https://github.com/kohlschutter/boilerpipe). This implementation does its best to mimick the algorithm described in the paper, but isn't quite exactly the same as the `boilerpipe` implementation.
