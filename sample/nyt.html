<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="310" data-total-count="310">WASHINGTON — Jake Williams awoke last April in an Orlando, Fla., hotel where he was leading a training session. Checking Twitter, Mr. Williams, a cybersecurity expert, was dismayed to discover that he had been thrust into the middle of one of the worst security debacles ever to befall American intelligence.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="591" data-total-count="901">Mr. Williams had written on his company blog about the Shadow Brokers, a mysterious group that had somehow obtained many of the hacking tools the United States used to spy on other countries. Now the group had replied in an angry screed on Twitter. It identified him — correctly — as a former member of the National Security Agency’s hacking group, Tailored Access Operations, or T.A.O., a job he had not publicly disclosed. Then the Shadow Brokers astonished him by dropping technical details that made clear they knew about highly classified hacking operations that he had conducted.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="87" data-total-count="988">America’s largest and most secretive intelligence agency had been deeply infiltrated.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="317" data-total-count="1305">“They had operational insight that even most of my fellow operators at T.A.O. did not have,” said Mr. Williams, now with Rendition Infosec, a cybersecurity firm he founded. “I felt like I’d been kicked in the gut. Whoever wrote this either was a well-placed insider or had stolen a lot of operational data.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="503" data-total-count="1808">The jolt to Mr. Williams from the Shadow Brokers’ riposte was part of a much broader earthquake that has shaken the N.S.A. to its core. Current and former agency officials say the Shadow Brokers disclosures, which began in August 2016, have been catastrophic for the N.S.A., calling into question its ability to protect potent cyberweapons and its very value to national security. The agency regarded as the world’s leader in breaking into adversaries’ computer networks failed to protect its own.</p><div id="story-ad-1" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

Three employees have been arrested since 2015 for taking classified files, but there is fear that one or more leakers may still be in place. And there is broad agreement that the damage from the Shadow Brokers already far exceeds the harm to American intelligence done by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor who fled with four laptops of classified material in 2013.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="501" data-total-count="3542">Mr. Snowden’s cascade of disclosures to journalists and his defiant public stance drew far more media coverage than this new breach. But Mr. Snowden released code words, while the Shadow Brokers have released the actual code; if he shared what might be described as battle plans, they have loosed the weapons themselves. Created at huge expense to American taxpayers, those cyberweapons have now been picked up by hackers from North Korea to Russia and shot back at the United States and its allies.</p><figure id="media-100000005548146" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000005548146" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/28/business/13shadowbrokers-dupe/28hack2-master675.png" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="447" data-total-count="8219">T.A.O. — the outdated name is still used informally — began years ago as a side project at the agency’s research and engineering building at Fort Meade. It was a cyber Skunk Works, akin to the special units that once built stealth aircraft and drones. As Washington’s need for hacking capabilities grew, T.A.O. expanded into a separate office park in Laurel, Md., with additional teams at facilities in Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii and Texas.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="766" data-total-count="8985">The hacking unit attracts many of the agency’s young stars, who like the thrill of internet break-ins in the name of national security, according to a dozen former government officials who agreed to describe its work on the condition of anonymity. T.A.O. analysts start with a shopping list of desired information and likely sources — say, a Chinese official’s home computer or a Russian oil company’s network. Much of T.A.O.’s work is labeled E.C.I., for “exceptionally controlled information,” material so sensitive it was initially stored only in safes. When the cumulative weight of the safes threatened the integrity of N.S.A.’s engineering building a few years ago, one agency veteran said, the rules were changed to allow locked file cabinets.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="390" data-total-count="9375">The more experienced T.A.O. operators devise ways to break into foreign networks; junior operators take over to extract information. Mr. Williams, 40, a former paramedic who served in military intelligence in the Army before joining the N.S.A., worked in T.A.O. from 2008 to 2013, which he described as an especially long tenure. He called the work “challenging and sometimes exciting.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="264" data-total-count="9639">T.A.O. operators must constantly renew their arsenal to stay abreast of changing software and hardware, examining every Windows update and new iPhone for vulnerabilities. “The nature of the business is to move with the technology,” a former T.A.O. hacker said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="361" data-total-count="10000">Long known mainly as an eavesdropping agency, the N.S.A. has embraced hacking as an especially productive way to spy on foreign targets. The intelligence collection is often automated, with malware implants — computer code designed to find material of interest — left sitting on the targeted system for months or even years, sending files back to the N.S.A.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="422" data-total-count="10422">The same implant can be used for many purposes: to steal documents, tap into email, subtly change data or become the launching pad for an attack. T.A.O.’s most public success was an operation against Iran called Olympic Games, in which implants in the network of the Natanz nuclear plant caused centrifuges enriching uranium to self-destruct. The T.A.O. was also critical to attacks on the Islamic State and North Korea.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="83" data-total-count="10505">It was this arsenal that the Shadow Brokers got hold of, and then began to release.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="526" data-total-count="11031">Like cops studying a burglar’s operating style and stash of stolen goods, N.S.A. analysts have tried to figure out what the Shadow Brokers took. None of the leaked files date from later than 2013 — a relief to agency officials assessing the damage. But they include a large share of T.A.O.’s collection, including three so-called ops disks — T.A.O.’s term for tool kits — containing the software to bypass computer firewalls, penetrate Windows and break into the Linux systems most commonly used on Android phones.</p><div id="story-ad-4" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

Some were designed for a compromise by the N.S.A. of Swift, a global financial messaging system, allowing the agency to track bank transfers. There was a manual for an old system code-named UNITEDRAKE, used to attack Windows. There were PowerPoint presentations and other files not used in hacking, making it unlikely that the Shadow Brokers had simply grabbed tools left on the internet by sloppy N.S.A. hackers.</p><figure id="media-100000005546996" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000005546996" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/13/us/13shadowbrokers7/merlin_129932267_135bc2e8-680f-492f-852c-d450a9aa3c4b-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">

But some T.A.O. hackers think that skilled, persistent attackers might have been able to get through the N.S.A.’s defenses — because, as one put it, “I know we’ve done it to other countries.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="455" data-total-count="12541">The Shadow Brokers have verbally attacked certain experts, including Mr. Williams. When he concluded from their Twitter hints that they knew about some of his hacks while at the N.S.A., he canceled a business trip to Singapore. The United States had named and criminally charged hackers from the intelligence agencies of China, Iran and Russia. He feared he could be similarly charged by a country he had targeted and arrested on an international warrant.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="147" data-total-count="12688">He has since resumed traveling abroad. But he says no one from the N.S.A. has contacted him about being singled out publicly by the Shadow Brokers.</p><div class="newsletter-signup hidden auto-newsletter variant-1-hidden " id="newsletter-promo" data-newsletter-productCode="" data-newsletter-productTitle="" aria-labeledby="newsletter-promo-heading">

I do not feel the government has my back.”</p><h4 class="story-subheading story-content" data-para-count="23" data-total-count="12860">The Hunt for an Insider</h4><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="234" data-total-count="13094">For decades after its creation in 1952, the N.S.A. — No Such Agency, in the old joke — was seen as all but leakproof. But since Mr. Snowden flew away with hundreds of thousands of documents in 2013, that notion has been shattered.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="406" data-total-count="13500">The Snowden trauma led to the investment of millions of dollars in new technology and tougher rules to counter what the government calls the insider threat. But N.S.A. employees say that with thousands of employees pouring in and out of the gates, and the ability to store a library’s worth of data in a device that can fit on a key ring, it is impossible to prevent people from walking out with secrets.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="776" data-total-count="14276">The agency has active investigations into at least three former N.S.A. employees or contractors. Two had worked for T.A.O.: a still publicly unidentified software developer secretly arrested after taking hacking tools home in 2015, only to have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/technology/kaspersky-lab-israel-russia-hacking.html">Russian hackers lift them from his home computer</a>; and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/20/us/harold-martin-nsa.html">Harold T. Martin III, a contractor arrested last year</a> when F.B.I. agents found his home, garden shed and car stuffed with sensitive agency documents and storage devices he had taken over many years when a work-at-home habit got out of control, his lawyers say. The third is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/us/politics/reality-leigh-winner-leak-nsa.html">Reality Winner, a young N.S.A. linguist arrested in June</a>, who is charged with leaking to the news site The Intercept a single classified report on a Russian breach of an American election systems vendor.</p><div id="story-ad-5" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="333" data-total-count="14609" id="story-continues-7">Mr. Martin’s gargantuan collection of stolen files included much of what the Shadow Brokers have, and he has been scrutinized by investigators as a possible source for them. Officials say they do not believe he deliberately supplied the material, though they have examined whether he might have been targeted by thieves or hackers.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="565" data-total-count="15174">But according to former N.S.A. employees who are still in touch with active workers, investigators of the Shadow Brokers thefts are clearly worried that one or more leakers may still be inside the agency. Some T.A.O. employees have been asked to turn over their passports, take time off their jobs and submit to questioning. The small number of specialists who have worked both at T.A.O. and at the C.I.A. have come in for particular attention, out of concern that a single leaker might be responsible for both the Shadow Brokers and the C.I.A.’s Vault7 breaches.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="521" data-total-count="15695">Then there are the Shadow Brokers’ writings, which betray a seeming immersion in American culture. Last April, about the time Mr. Williams was discovering their inside knowledge of T.A.O. operations, the Shadow Brokers posted an appeal to President Trump: “Don’t Forget Your Base.” With the ease of a seasoned pundit, they tossed around details about Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s now departed adviser; the Freedom Caucus in Congress; the “deep state”; the Alien and Sedition Acts; and white privilege.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="151" data-total-count="15846">“TheShadowBrokers is wanting to see you succeed,” the post said, addressing Mr. Trump. “TheShadowBrokers is wanting America to be great again.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="335" data-total-count="16181">The mole hunt is inevitably creating an atmosphere of suspicion and anxiety, former employees say. While the attraction of the N.S.A. for skilled operators is unique — nowhere else can they hack without getting into legal trouble — the boom in cybersecurity hiring by private companies gives T.A.O. veterans lucrative exit options.</p><figure id="news-tips-article-promo" class="interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-small">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="464" data-total-count="16645">Young T.A.O. hackers are lucky to make $80,000 a year, while those who leave routinely find jobs paying well over $100,000, security specialists say. For many workers, the appeal of the N.S.A’s mission has been more than enough to make up the difference. But over the past year, former T.A.O. employees say an increasing number of former colleagues have called them looking for private-sector work, including “graybeards” they thought would be N.S.A. lifers.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="234" data-total-count="16879">“Snowden killed morale,” another T.A.O. analyst said. “But at least we knew who he was. Now you have a situation where the agency is questioning people who have been 100 percent mission-oriented, telling them they’re liars.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="235" data-total-count="17114">Because the N.S.A. hacking unit has grown so rapidly over the past decade, the pool of potential leakers has expanded into the hundreds.

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="260" data-total-count="17374" id="story-continues-8">Some agency veterans have seen projects they worked on for a decade shut down because implants they relied on were dumped online by the Shadow Brokers. The number of new operations has declined because the malware tools must be rebuilt. And no end is in sight.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="162" data-total-count="17536">“How much longer are the releases going to come?” a former T.A.O. employee asked. “The agency doesn’t know how to stop it — or even what ‘it’ is.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="458" data-total-count="17994">One N.S.A. official who almost saw his career ended by the Shadow Brokers is at the very top of the organization: Adm. Michael S. Rogers, director of the N.S.A. and commander of its sister military organization, United States Cyber Command. President Barack Obama’s director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., and defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter, recommended removing Admiral Rogers from his post to create accountability for the breaches.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="428" data-total-count="18422">But Mr. Obama did not act on the advice, in part because Admiral Rogers’s agency was at the center of the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. Mr. Trump, who again on Saturday disputed his intelligence agencies’ findings on Russia and the election, extended the admiral’s time in office. Some former intelligence officials say they are flabbergasted that he has been able to hold on to his job.</p><h4 class="story-subheading story-content" data-para-count="25" data-total-count="18447">A Shadow War With Russia?</h4><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="291" data-total-count="18738">Lurking in the background of the Shadow Brokers investigation is American officials’ strong belief that it is a Russian operation. The pattern of dribbling out stolen documents over many months, they say, echoes the slow release of Democratic emails purloined by Russian hackers last year.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="76" data-total-count="18814">But there is a more specific back story to the United States-Russia rivalry.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="344" data-total-count="19158">Starting in 2014, American security researchers who had been tracking Russia’s state-sponsored hacking groups for years began to expose them in a series of research reports. American firms, including Symantec, CrowdStrike and FireEye, reported that Moscow was behind certain attacks and identified government-sponsored Russian hacking groups.</p><figure id="media-100000005481893" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000005481893 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/13/us/13shadowbrokers3/06NSA2-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="348" data-total-count="19506">In the meantime, Russia’s most prominent cybersecurity firm, Kaspersky Lab, had started work on a report that would turn the tables on the United States. Kaspersky hunted for the spying malware planted by N.S.A. hackers, guided in part by the keywords and code names in the files taken by Mr. Snowden and published by journalists, officials said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="486" data-total-count="19992">Kaspersky was, in a sense, simply doing to the N.S.A. what the American companies had just done to Russian intelligence: expose their operations. And American officials believe <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/technology/kaspersky-lab-israel-russia-hacking.html">Russian intelligence was piggybacking on Kaspersky’s efforts</a> to find and retrieve the N.S.A.’s secrets wherever they could be found. The T.A.O. hackers knew that when Kaspersky updated its popular antivirus software to find and block the N.S.A. malware, it could thwart spying operations around the world.</p><div id="story-ad-7" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="136" data-total-count="20128" id="story-continues-9">So T.A.O. personnel rushed to replace implants in many countries with new malware they did not believe the Russian company could detect.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="449" data-total-count="20577">In February 2015, Kaspersky published its report on the Equation Group — the company’s name for T.A.O. hackers — and updated its antivirus software to uproot the N.S.A. malware wherever it had not been replaced. The agency temporarily lost access to a considerable flow of intelligence. By some accounts, however, N.S.A. officials were relieved that the Kaspersky report did not include certain tools they feared the Russian company had found.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="52" data-total-count="20629">As it would turn out, any celebration was premature.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="149" data-total-count="20778">On Aug. 13 last year, a new Twitter account using the Shadow Brokers’ name announced with fanfare an online auction of stolen N.S.A. hacking tools.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="109" data-total-count="20887">“We hack Equation Group,” the Shadow Brokers wrote. “We find many many Equation Group cyber weapons.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="258" data-total-count="21145">Inside the N.S.A., the declaration was like a bomb exploding. A zip file posted online contained the first free sample of the agency’s hacking tools. It was immediately evident that the Shadow Brokers were not hoaxsters, and that the agency was in trouble.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="665" data-total-count="21810">The leaks have renewed a debate over whether the N.S.A. should be permitted to stockpile vulnerabilities it discovers in commercial software to use for spying — rather than immediately alert software makers so the holes can be plugged. The agency claims it has shared with the industry more than 90 percent of flaws it has found, reserving only the most valuable for its own hackers. But if it can’t keep those from leaking, as the last year has demonstrated, the resulting damage to businesses and ordinary computer users around the world can be colossal. The Trump administration says it will soon announce revisions to the system, making it more transparent.</p><button class="button comments-button  theme-speech-bubble-large" data-skip-to-para-id="">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="339" data-total-count="22149">Mr. Williams said it may be years before the “full fallout” of the Shadow Brokers breach is understood. Even the arrest of whoever is responsible for the leaks may not end them, he said — because the sophisticated perpetrators may have built a “dead man’s switch” to release all remaining files automatically upon their arrest.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="210" data-total-count="22359">“We’re obviously dealing with people who have operational security knowledge,” he said. “They have the whole law enforcement system and intelligence system after them. And they haven’t been caught.”</p><footer class="story-footer story-content">
